1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
Answer: the two values of Boolean data type are True and False.
Example a=True
        b=False


2.What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
Answer: and,or and not are the three different Boolean operators.

3.Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean
values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
A. AND Truth Table
    A     B      A AND B
    True  False  False
    False True   False
    True True    True
    False False  False
  OR Truth Table
    A    B      A OR B
    True  True   True
    False True  True
    True  False  True
    False False False
   NOT Truth Table
   
   A    NOT A
   True  False
   False True

4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
not (5 > 4)
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
(True and True) and (True == False)
(not False) or (not True)
Answer : (5>4) and (3==5)-->False
         not(5>4) ---->False
         (5>4) or (3==5)-->True
         not((5>4) or (3==5))-->False
         (True and True) and (True==False)-->False
         (not False) or (not True)-->True


5. What are the six comparison operators?
Answer: The comparison operators:
>,>=,<,<=,==,!=



6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.
Answer: Equal to operator ==
        Assignment operator =
        equal to is used when we want to compare two variables eg if (A==B):
        Assignment is used when we want to assign a value to a variable. eg A=5
        
7.Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')
Answer:     spam = 0
            if spam == 10:--->First Block
            print('eggs')
            if spam > 5:-->Second Block
            print('bacon')
            else:----------->Third Block
            print('ham')
            print('spam')
            print('spam')



8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
Answer:
if spam==1:
print("Hello")
elif spam==2:
print("Howdy")
else:
print("Greetings!")



9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?
Answer: We can press Ctlr+C to end an endless loop


10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
Answer: break statement breaks out of the block where it is getting executed
Example: for i in range(1,10):
          if i==2:
            break---------------------> breaks the for loop and control goes to next set of statements after the for loop
      continue statement skips the current iteration and makes the control go to the next iteration
      for i in range(1,10):
        if i==2:
          continue------------------> here it skips the for loop for i value equal to 2.




11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
Answer:   example: for i in range(10):
                      print(i,end=" ")---------------->0 1 2 3 4 5 6  7 8 9

                    for i in range(0,10):
                       print(i,end=" ")-------------> 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
                    for i in range(0,10,1):
                       print(i,end=" ")----------------->0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
As we can see range(0,10) here we are specifying the start and end point for the for loop.
range(0,10,1) here we can specify the start,end point and the skip count as well that is from the start point use the skip-count till we reach the end point
range(10)  here we are specifying the end point only so it will start from 0 (by default) and reach till 9.



12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
Answer:
for i in range(1,11):
print(i,end=" ")----------> 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

i=1
while(i<11):
print(i,end=" ")----------> 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 
i=i+1




13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
Answer: import spam
        spam.bacon()
